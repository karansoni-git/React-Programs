=>The useCallback Hook

The useCallback hook in React is used to memoize a callback function, preventing it from being recreated on every render unless its dependencies change.

=>syntax:
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  // your callback logic
}, [dependencies]);

ðŸ“Œ Why use useCallback?
In React, functions are re-created on every render. If you pass these functions as props to child components, it can cause unnecessary re-renders, even if the logic inside hasn't changed.

useCallback helps avoid this by returning a memoized version of the function that only changes if its dependencies do.

1. Memoization: Preserves function across renders to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
2. Optimization: Enhances performance in components with frequent updates.
3. Dependency Array: Recreates the functiononly when specific dependencies change.
4. Event Handlers: Used to keep consistent function references for child components.
5. With useEffect: Prevents infinite loops by maintaining function references

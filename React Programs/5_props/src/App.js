  /*In React, props (short for "properties") are a way of passing data from one component to another.
  Think of props like function arguments:
  You send data into a component by giving it props.
  Inside the component, you use those props to decide what to display or how to behave.
  *
  =>Props are read-only â†’ You cannot change them inside the child component.
  =>They make components dynamic and reusable.
  =>Props are usually passed from parent to child component.
